# MySports Mobile

MySports is the final group project which was created in order to complete the Berlin TechLabs Bootcamp. MySports is an event creation platform specifically aimed to match users into teams for various sports. Users are matched based on search criteria and filters and then are able to communicate in an integrated event chatroom to discuss details. This repo aims to recreate the project using React-Native with TypScript whilst using the backend API of the original project. A deployed browser version can be found here:
